# Maestro
Maestro is an opinionated framework designed to streamline the orchestration of reconcilers within the Kubernetes ecosystem. By adopting a clear and structured approach, Maestro simplifies the registration, execution, and management of reconcilers, enabling developers to focus on the core logic of their applications without getting bogged down by the intricacies of Kubernetes resource management.

## Overview
At the heart of Maestro lies the Conductor interface, an elegant solution for managing the lifecycle of multiple reconcilers. By encapsulating the complexity involved in the registration and execution processes, Maestro offers a straightforward pathway for developers to integrate their reconcilers with Kubernetes resources.

## Key Components
- Conductor: A generic interface that facilitates the registration and coordination of reconcilers. It acts as the central hub through which all reconcilers are managed.
- Reconciler: An interface defining the essential method Reconcile, which encapsulates the logic for reconciling the state of a Kubernetes resource.
- DescriptReconciler: An extension of the Reconciler interface, adding a Descriptor method for providing metadata about the reconciler, such as its name and description.
